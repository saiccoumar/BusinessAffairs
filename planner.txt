Focus: An application that will help hide sensitive desktop information upon detection of human presence in a given camera viewpoint.

--------------------

[#Flow]
-> Splashscreen (?)
-> Initial run
	-> Prompt user which is the desired camera and microphone input
	-> Prompt user on keybinds for functions (see #Keybinds)
	-> (proceed to normal run)
-> Normal run
	-> Follow config (see #Config)
	-> Run discretely in background, minimal resource usage
-> Exit (cleanly exit)

[#Triggers] - results in #Behaviors run
- Detected movement in camera
- Detected aural movement, spikes, or presence
	
[#Behaviors] - emergency events triggered by #Trigger
- Minimize all windows
- Minimize all windows, create new desktop (?)
- Minimize all windows, create new desktop, open defined application (?)
- Mute all audio output (attention: multiple audio outputs are possible)
- Blackout monitors
- Custom user-programmed routine (somehow...?)

[#Config]
- Minimize to system tray on start
- Run on system startup
- Behaviors (see #Behaviors)
	
[#Keybinds] - MAKE SURE TO NOT INTERFERE WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS
(Ctrl + Shift + B) Enable/Disable detection (critical -> when disabled, do not use the camera to save system resources?)
(Ctrl + Shift + Alt + B) Bring back application window
(Ctrl + Shift + Alt + R) End emergency, false alert declaration
